# Reverse-File

Taken from an exercise at Queen Mary University of London! 

Directions: "Write a program that replaces each line of a file with its reverse. For example if you 
run:
> java Reverse HelloPrinter.java

Then the contents of 
HelloPrinter.java
are changed to
retnirPolleH ssalc cilbup
{
)sgra ][gnirtS(niam diov citats cilbup
{
wodniw elosnoc eht ni gniteerg a yalpsiD //
;)”dlroW , olleH”(nltnirp.tuo.metsyS
}
}

Of course, if you run Reverse twice on the same file, you get the original file."
